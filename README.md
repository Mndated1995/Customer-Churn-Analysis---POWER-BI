# Case Study: Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI

### Dashboard Link : Analyzing Customer Churn.pbix

## Description
For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this Power BI case study, I investigated a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesnâ€™t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: itâ€™s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. I answered these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.

#**Key Insights from Datatel's Churn Analysis Overview:**

This Power BI case study investigated customer churn for Datatel, a telecom company. Here are the key findings:

1. High Overall Churn Rate: Datatel has a churn rate of 26.86%, which means they lose a significant portion of their customers every year.
2. Top Reasons for Churn: The main reasons customers churn are competitor offers (better devices or services) and poor customer support.
3. High Churn in California: California has a churn rate of 63.34%, significantly higher than the national average.


These insights suggest that Datatel needs to improve their customer offerings and customer service to reduce churn. 

#**Here are some specific actions they could take:**

1. Analyze competitor offerings: Identify what competitors are offering that Datatel is not and develop competitive offers.
2. Improve customer support: Train customer support representatives to provide excellent service and address customer concerns promptly.
3. Target California customers: Develop targeted marketing campaigns and promotions for customers in California to address the high churn rate in that state.

#**Key Insights from Datatel's Churn Analysis Overview:**

Customer Service Calls and Monthly Plans

The provided data suggests that customers on monthly data plans tend to make more customer service calls compared to those on yearly plans.

This analysis indicates that monthly plan customers might require more frequent support, potentially due to:

1. Billing issues: Monthly plans may involve more frequent billing cycles, leading to a higher chance of encountering billing problems.
2. Plan changes: Monthly plans offer more flexibility to change plans, which might lead to confusion or require customer service assistance.
3. Technical difficulties: Since monthly plans cater to a wider range of users, there might be a higher variety of technical issues requiring support.



### Recommendations **

Streamline Billing Processes:

1. Simplify billing cycles: Evaluate the possibility of simplifying billing cycles for monthly plans to reduce confusion and potential issues.
2. Offer clear and concise billing statements: Ensure bills are easy to understand and contain all necessary information.
3. Provide online self-service options: Allow customers to view and manage their bills online, reducing the need for customer service calls.

Enhance Customer Support for Monthly Plan Customers:

1. Dedicated support channels: Create specific support channels or teams to cater to the unique needs of monthly plan customers.
2. Proactive support: Implement proactive measures to address potential issues before customers need to contact support (e.g., automated notifications, troubleshooting guides).
3. Customer satisfaction surveys: Regularly gather feedback from monthly plan customers to identify pain points and areas for improvement.
